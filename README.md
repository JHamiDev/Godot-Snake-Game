This is a clone/remake of snake made using the Godot game engine and is written using Godot's built-in programming language called GDScript

This version of snake does not use Godot's tilemap system for the snake's movement but rather the divisibility of the x and y values of the snake's head position to imitate grid based movement

This project was completed in under a week as practice so it may still have many issues

*Game does not contain any sound effects or music

*GAME DOES NOT SAVE HIGHSCORE - will reset every time game is run

## Controls
- Arrow keys to move
- space to reset game (when on game over screen)
